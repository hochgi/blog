<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>
<p>Well… initially the blog was written as simple markdown posts. Markdown is an obvious choice for a blog, easy to write and maintain. I decided to render the markdown ad-hoc, so I used pagedown extra<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. I also added syntax highlighting using <a href="https://highlightjs.org/">highlight.js</a>. This was simple and easy. Integrating with blogger was not too much of a fuss, I just wrapped every markdown post with:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode html"><code class="sourceCode html"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="kw">&lt;div</span><span class="ot"> class=</span><span class="st">&quot;markdown&quot;</span><span class="ot"> style=</span><span class="st">&quot;display: none;&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true"></a>  # markdown content went here</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="kw">&lt;/div&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>And added a small js snippet to the theme HTML editor:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="co">// Yup! jquery was still a thing back then.</span></span>

<p>I also added there the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags with <code>src</code> of the libraries I used, directly hosted from my github account through <a href="https://rawgit.com/">rawgit</a>. It worked out as expected.</p>
<h3 id="the-plot-thickens">The plot thickens</h3>
<p>Throughout the years, blogger made all <a href="https://blogger.googleblog.com/2018/05/its-spring-cleaning-time-for-blogger.html">sorts</a> <a href="https://blogger.googleblog.com/2019/01/an-update-on-google-and-blogger.html">of</a> <a href="https://blogger.googleblog.com/2020/05/a-better-blogger-experience-on-web.html">changes</a>, that occassionaly caused my blog to break in weird ways. Patching it every couple of years was not such a big deal. But at some point, I decided I want to <del>shoot myself in the foot</del> add \(\LaTeX\) in my posts, so I added <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a> to the mix.</p>
<p>At that point, all the patching I did throughout the years, together with adding MathJax, turned the cute little snippet above into some <a href="https://github.com/hochgi/blog/blob/388cdd23388b370ef1b050aae450368779b85f98/js/highlight.plus.markdown.js">serious dumpster fire</a>.</p>
<p>Unsuprisingly, the blog became unusable in recent years. Rawgit service has been shutdown. libraries became outdated. And my script broke in weird ways.</p>
<h3 id="time-to-refactor">Time to refactor</h3>
<p>OK then, obviously maintaining the blog with scripts to render markdown + syntax highlighting + \(\LaTeX\) inside blogger is not something I want to continue doing. So I was thinking: what are my options?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Ditch blogger and host the blog somewhere I fully control.</li>
<li>Use blogger with pre-rendered HTML. Without any scripting shenanigans.</li>
</ol>
<p>I didn’t want to ditch blogger. It’s convenient, support out of the box to some nice stats with google analytics. No need to care about hosting. etc’…</p>
<p>So I tried converting all my posts to HTML.</p>
<h3 id="attempt-1">Attempt #1</h3>
<p>I needed \(\LaTeX\) for all the nifty equations and I only used markdown to format the text nicely. Well… that’s exactly what \(\LaTeX\) is for. So I figured I can just reformat all my posts to \(\LaTeX\), and then convert the <code>.tex</code> files to HTML using <a href="https://tug.org/tex4ht/"><code>htlatex</code></a>. Obviously, I’ll write future posts directly in \(\LaTeX\) instead of markdown. All I needed was to figure out how to do the syntax highlighting for code blocks.</p>
<p>I’ve used syntax highlighting in \(\LaTeX\) <a href="https://github.com/hochgi/latex-stuff/tree/master/observable">before</a>, but needed something simpler and easier to maintain. I went for <a href="https://ftp.cc.uoc.gr/mirrors/CTAN/macros/latex/contrib/listings/listings.pdf">Listings</a>, as it seemed the most suitable solution. The <a href="https://github.com/hochgi/blog/tree/5a279ce801644ee5d1b05b2aa96f1666cae5908c/tex">result</a> was… ok. The scala language<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> support was not ideal. The parser/lexer did not recognized stuff like class names, or types. But it’s possible to “help” it a bit, by providing extra tokens with their style. The code blocks themselves were not as nice as I hoped: <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hochgi/blog/master/img/facelift_01.png" alt="glitch-lines between the rows" /> But the real deal breaker, was the fact that <code>htlatex</code> was not able to export listings as HTML.</p>
<h3 id="attempt-2">Attempt #2</h3>
<p>Even before the last experiment, I had a gut feeling against it. The “pipeline” was not very simple. Export markdown to \(\LaTeX\) → fix \(\LaTeX\) &amp; syntax highlights manually → export to HTML using <code>htlatex</code> → maybe even fix HTML itself?</p>
<p>Well, MathJax already works great, and if I only add MathJax, the integration with blogger should be simple enough. So I went for direct markdown → HTML, and left MathJax inlined in the HTML.</p>
<p>I used <a href="https://pandoc.org/"><code>pandoc</code></a> to convert the markdown files to HTML. Unfortunately, syntax highlight for scala code with pandoc isn’t great as well, but I figured I could easily just patch the HTML output directly. I decided this is good enough for now and I should stop shaving this yak. Since I need to touch the HTML output a bit<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, I figured I should commit it to the blog repo as well.</p>
<h3 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h3>
<p>So now the blog is up and running again. All posts were converted, and everything works well. I will probably change the theme sometime soon (I chose the first thing just to get on with the tweaks). I also noticed some “inacuracies<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>” I should fix in some old posts. Perhaps archive the less relevant topics. But I also noticed many drafts I started and never finished over the years: <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hochgi/blog/master/img/facelift_02.png" alt="draft posts" /> There’s some interesting ideas in these drafts I should definately write about. I guess we’ll see soon.</p>
