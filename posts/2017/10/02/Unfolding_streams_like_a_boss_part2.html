<p>In the <a href="https://hochgi.blogspot.co.il/2017/08/unfolding-streams-like-boss-part-1.html?view=classic">previous post</a> we introduced CM-Well’s <a href="https://github.com/thomsonreuters/CM-Well/blob/7af690adf2c196e15309ee2b6bdf5536f035780b/docs/API.Stream.ConsumeNextChunk.md"><code>consume</code> API</a>, and showed how it is tailored to be used with <em>akka-http</em> &amp; <em>akka-stream</em>. This post will get into the gory details of how to squeeze the most out of CM-Well, using the <a href="https://github.com/thomsonreuters/CM-Well/blob/7af690adf2c196e15309ee2b6bdf5536f035780b/docs/API.Stream.ConsumeNextBulk.md"><code>bulk-consume</code> API</a> with <em>akka-http</em> &amp; <em>akka-stream</em>.</p>
<h2 id="the-consume-api-in-depth">The <code>consume</code> API in depth</h2>
<p>There are two types of “consumes”, <code>consume</code> &amp; <code>bulk-consume</code>. We will focus on the latter. But a few words on <code>consume</code> to not leave you hanging: <code>consume</code> just wraps a regular search, with a few extra filters. in terms of CM-Well’s <code>qp</code>, it translate to the following:</p>
<p>Given filters <code>qp=$QP</code> and an timestamp <code>index-time=${ITIME:-0}</code>, CM-Well generates the following (loosely) equivalent search parameters:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="co"># set to current time minus 30 seconds</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="va">NOW=$(</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true"></a>  <span class="va">MILLIS=$(</span>  <span class="fu">date</span> +%s%N <span class="kw">|</span> <span class="fu">cut</span> -b1-13 <span class="va">)</span></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4" aria-hidden="true"></a>  <span class="ex">calc</span> <span class="va">$MILLIS</span> - 30000</span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="va">)</span></span>
<span id="cb1-6"><a href="#cb1-6" aria-hidden="true"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-7"><a href="#cb1-7" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="st">&quot;?op=search</span></span>
<span id="cb1-8"><a href="#cb1-8" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="st"> &amp;qp=system.indexTime&gt;</span><span class="va">$ITIME</span><span class="st">,system.indexTime&lt;</span><span class="va">$NOW</span><span class="st">,[</span><span class="va">$QP</span><span class="st">]</span></span>
<span id="cb1-9"><a href="#cb1-9" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="st"> &amp;sort-by=system.indexTime</span></span>
<span id="cb1-10"><a href="#cb1-10" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="st"> &amp;length=100&quot;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>It then fetches those (up to) 100 (by default) sorted results, and: if all results has the same index time <code>SOME_ITIME</code>, it will replace the previous <code>op=search</code> with <code>op=stream</code>, and previous <code>qp=system.indexTime&gt;$ITIME,system.indexTime&lt;$NOW,[$QP]</code> with <code>qp=system.indexTime:$SOME_ITIME,[$QP]</code>. else it will have multiple values, all sorted. it will drop all the tailing results with index time = <code>$MAX_ITIME</code>, and return the rest, with a token in the header setting the next <code>$ITIME</code> to be <code>$MAX_ITIME - 1</code>.</p>
<p>These are the basics, the are a few more concerns to take into consideration, and if thats interest you, go ahead and check <a href="https://github.com/thomsonreuters/CM-Well/blob/4f0e644739d5569d572dc200093af87f99e0d281/server/cmwell-ws/app/controllers/Application.scala#L1420-L1646">the source code</a>.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-bulk-consume">Understanding <code>bulk-consume</code></h2>
<p>In contrast to <code>consume</code> API, <code>bulk-consume</code> tries to be more efficient, and retrieve a lot more infotons per request à la <code>stream</code> style. Under the hood it uses Elasticsearch’s scroll API in a similar way to how we described <code>stream</code> API is made in the previous post. The problem is, that you can’t get sorted results with scroll from Elasticsearch. So, instead of advancing the timeline using sorted search, we filter results in advance.</p>
<p>This means there’s a pre-processing phase where we try to find a <em>from</em> and <em>to</em> timestamps, that are not “too far” apart, in terms of number of results, but enough to stream efficiently. CM-Well does it using a simple binary search to do so, and it tries to return a chunked response with <em>O(1M)</em> results (by default). There are many edge cases covered, like an early cutoff, if the binary search doesn’t converged fast enough, And dealing with near current time results, etc’…</p>
<p>Like <code>consume</code>, <code>bulk-consume</code> returns a position token in headers. In fact, the tokens are interchangeable between the 2 APIs, But those returned from a <code>bulk-consume</code> request, might contain some extra attributes. It turns out, that many pre-processing phases can be avoided if previous request stored an optional next “to” timestamp it might have encounterd during the binary search. So, what’s so great about the <code>bulk-consume</code> API? <strong>pipelined parallelization!</strong> You see, the next position token is given eagerly in the response headers, and a user can use it right away to fire up the next request. Since it will probably take some time to fetch all those <em>O(1M)</em> results, you could end up with as many parallel streams of data that you can handle.</p>
<p>But, you might ask: <em>“What about failures? retrying?”</em>, the answer is, that bulk consume also let’s you set upper bound timestamp explicitly. If your token was an optimized one, you can reuse it safely. If not, a new binary search might yield different time range, and you could end up with duplicate results, or worse, data gaps. To overcome this, you should supply a timestamp explicitly when retrying. But, what should you supply? Well, there’s another header for that. Other than <code>X-CM-WELL-POSITION</code> header, you also get <code>X-CM-WELL-TO</code> header, and the value is the upper bound timestamp found in the binary search. You should supply this timestamp using <code>to-hint</code> query parameter, and retry the <code>bulk-consume</code> request with it. Note that if the position token is optimized, <code>to-hint</code> will be ignored.</p>
<h2 id="ok-got-it.-lets-write-some-code">OK, got it. let’s write some code</h2>
<p>As implied, we will show how to build an <em>akka-stream</em> <code>Source</code> of data from CM-Well, using <code>unfoldFlow</code>, <code>Retry</code>, and other cool constructs you can find on <em>akka-stream</em> &amp; <em>akka-stream-contrib</em> libs.</p>
<h3 id="the-easy-part-motivation">The easy part (motivation)</h3>
<p>Assuming we can somehow get:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode scala"><code class="sourceCode scala"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="kw">type</span> PositionToken = String</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="kw">val</span> initialPosition: PositionToken = ???</span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="kw">val</span> consume: Flow[PositionToken,(PositionToken,ByteString),_] = ???</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The work left is ridiculously easy thanks to <code>unfoldFlow</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode scala"><code class="sourceCode scala"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true"></a>SourceGen.<span class="fu">unfoldFlow</span>(initialPosition)(consume)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And we’re done! OK… not really… It’s too simplified. <code>unfoldFlow</code> can’t unfold the next element until it gets the previous generated state. This means that all our fancy talk about pipelining parallelization isn’t being taken into consideration here. So let’s try and improve that. How ’bout:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode scala"><code class="sourceCode scala"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="kw">val</span> consume: Flow[PositionToken,(PositionToken,Source[ByteString,_]),_] = ???</span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2" aria-hidden="true"></a>SourceGen.<span class="fu">unfoldFlow</span>(initialPosition)(consume)</span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a href="#cb4-3" aria-hidden="true"></a>         .<span class="fu">flatMapConcat</span>(List.<span class="fu">apply</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is already much better. Each <code>bulk-consume</code> Source is being queried eagerly. But we still have a downside here… bulks are not evenly sized, and size is counted as the number of infotons in the bulk. Not their actual size… Moreover, we mentioned retries are supported using <code>to-hint</code> with <code>X-CM-WELL-TO</code> header’s value. So, if we are going to retry some streams, this means we need to buffer an entire chunk, and only emit once we know it is complete, so we don’t get duplicate results from retries. This implies a single bulk can get us “stuck” waiting for it. The 2 major problems are: * No matter how high we set up our parallelization factor, we could still end up back-pressuring our slow source (by slow, I mean that whatever the use-case, we must assume a fast consumer. e.g: flush to disk, which is much faster than our network calls). * Having <code>$parallelization-factor × O(1M)</code> all buffer into memory, makes our GC inefficient, due to objects kept in memory for long time. And also we cause our downstream to be in starvation until we “unstuck” the current bulk.</p>
<p>So, since bulk are not sorted according to timeline anyway, then no reason not to use <code>merge</code> instead of <code>concat</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode scala"><code class="sourceCode scala"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true"></a>SourceGen.<span class="fu">unfoldFlow</span>(initialPosition)(consume)</span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2" aria-hidden="true"></a>         .<span class="fu">flatMapMerge</span>(identity)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Also, we will try to optimize even further. Our queries to <code>bulk-consume</code> are our “bottle-neck”. So, it is better to not pull in all the data with the bulk. let’s use a thin format, like <code>tsv</code>, which won’t return data itself, only a tuple consisting of infoton’s path, date, uuid, and indexTime. This way, we can at a later stage pull in data of small batches of infotons we got from the bulk consume. So our final higher level stream should either look like:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="sourceCode scala"><code class="sourceCode scala"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="kw">val</span> consume: Flow[PositionToken,(PositionToken,Source[List[ByteString],_]),_] = ???</span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="kw">val</span> addData: Flow[List[ByteString],ByteString,_] = ???</span>
<span id="cb6-3"><a href="#cb6-3" aria-hidden="true"></a>SourceGen.<span class="fu">unfoldFlow</span>(initialPosition)(consume)</span>
<span id="cb6-4"><a href="#cb6-4" aria-hidden="true"></a>         .<span class="fu">flatMapMerge</span>(identity)</span>
<span id="cb6-5"><a href="#cb6-5" aria-hidden="true"></a>         .<span class="fu">mapConcat</span>(identity)</span>
<span id="cb6-6"><a href="#cb6-6" aria-hidden="true"></a>         .<span class="fu">via</span>(addData)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>where <code>addData</code> flow utilizes <code>Balance</code> to fan out and parallelize data fetching job, and then fan back in to construct a <code>Flow</code> shape which takes care of parallelization internally. Another option, is to use a simpler <code>mapAsync(parallelizationFactor)(...)</code> to get an easier way to parallelize the data fetching job. Or, it can look like:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="sourceCode scala"><code class="sourceCode scala"><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="kw">val</span> consume: Flow[PositionToken,(PositionToken,Source[List[ByteString],_]),_] = ???</span>
<span id="cb7-2"><a href="#cb7-2" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="kw">val</span> addData: Flow[List[ByteString],ByteString,_] = ???</span>
<span id="cb7-3"><a href="#cb7-3" aria-hidden="true"></a>SourceGen.<span class="fu">unfoldFlow</span>(initialPosition)(consume)</span>
<span id="cb7-4"><a href="#cb7-4" aria-hidden="true"></a>         .<span class="fu">flatMapMerge</span>(_.<span class="fu">via</span>(addData))</span></code></pre></div>
<p>OK, armed with our goal in mind, let’s implement the <code>consume</code> flow: ### The detailed part Let’s try to break down &amp; visualize the stream:</p>
<ul>
<li>Retry:
<ul>
<li>bulk-consume ~&gt; fold results into a single element</li>
<li>if #lines != <code>X-CM-WELL-N</code> header or any other failure:
<ul>
<li>retry with <code>to-hint=${X-CM-WELL-TO}</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>else
<ul>
<li>emit results</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Enrich with data:
<ul>
<li>batch paths</li>
<li><code>Balance</code> vs. <code>mapAsync</code> parallelization of fetching (we’ll introduce both approaches)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>This might be covered in a future post. Currently, It has been sitting untouched for too long, and I’m “flushing” it. For now, implementation details are left as an excersize for the reader ;)</p>
