<p>CM-Well is the project Iv’e worked on in <a href="https://twitter.com/thomsonreuters">Thomson Reuters</a> for the past few years. I’m not gonna write here about the project itself (there’s more than enough information in the <a href="https://github.com/thomsonreuters/CM-Well/blob/master/server/cmwell-docs/cmwell-infodocs/CM-Well.RootTOC.md">project docs</a>), instead, I’ll write on my personal experience working on it.</p>
<h2 id="so-whats-now">So what’s now?</h2>
<p>Well, this is just the first post in a series of posts I plan to publish, dealing with CM-Well development. You can expect follow-up posts on, e.g: “A tale of bad framework choises (and how it led to interesting code)”, or “CM-Well &amp; OSS before it became OSS”, and more…</p>
