## Ummm... what is this CM-Well thing?
CM-Well is the project Iv'e worked on in [Thomson Reuters](https://twitter.com/thomsonreuters) for the past few years. I'm not gonna write here about the project itself (there's more than enough information in the [project docs](https://github.com/thomsonreuters/CM-Well/blob/master/server/cmwell-docs/cmwell-infodocs/CM-Well.RootTOC.md)), instead, I'll write on my personal experience working on it.

## So what's now?
Well, this is just the first post in a series of posts I plan to publish, dealing with CM-Well development. You can expect follow-up posts on, e.g: "A tale of bad framework choises (and how it led to interesting code)", or "CM-Well & OSS before it became OSS", and more...
