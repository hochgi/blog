## Background
My twitter feed is becoming more and more (pure) FP oriented. Many of the people I follow from the Scala community are advocating for Haskell over Scala lately. To be honest, I was always intrigued about pure FP, but never got to use it in the "real world"[^footnote1]. I always worked in teams that had OOP mindset, and codebase. With Scala I was able to shift the balance a little bit towards FP. I advocated for referential transparency, strongly typed over stringly typed code, higher order functions, higher kinded types, typeclasses, etc'...
I aimed to be more FP in an OO world. But I never managed to get my peers into learning together, and using, "pure FP" with libraries like cats or scalaz. So I wonder, does pure FP really is the answer - the silver bullet - I'm looking for?

## Is pure FP really useful in the "real world" or is it too hyped?
In the latest [scalapeno conference](https://www.scalapeno2018.com), I heard [John De Goes](https://twitter.com/jdegoes)'s keynote "[The Last Hope for Scala's Infinity War](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8IQ-X2HkGE)". In the talk, John claimed that:
> "Some of the proposed features in Scala 3 are targeting someone who doesn't exist"

He referred to features like Type Classes & Effect System.
![features for no one](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hochgi/blog/master/img/jdg01_type_classes.png)

But the truth is, that john was wrong. There is at least one person that wants such features[^footnote2].
There is a middle-ground. And I want to believe I'm not alone, and some other people see the value Scala has to offer for FP lovers (wannabes?) working with traditional OO programmers, trying to make a difference.

Like John, I love Scala. but unlike John, I don't think we need to

And I don't want to see all the crossed out features removed from Scala:

## Scala is expressive
I was asked today, why I love Scala. I answered that with Scala,
It's very easy for me to express exactly what I mean for the program to do.
I was then asked to give an example, of short code that I find easy to express in Scala,
and hard(er) to write in other languages. I choose something I've written a while ago,
and I find as a nice example for a FP-ish pattern.
```scala
def foo[A,B](as:       Iterable[A])
            (f:    A  => Future[B])
            (g: (B,B) => Future[B]): Future[B]
```
So... what's so special about `foo`? The quick FP thinker will write something like:
```scala
Future.traverse(as)(f).reduce(g) // if g were (B,B) => B
```
And it can be fine, considering the usecase.
It wasn't fine in my case.

### The "real world" case
Consider `A` to be, e.g: file names to fetch from a S3 bucket.
But not just any file, it's a CSV with time series events.
`B` is a time based aggregated states series of the events.
`f` can be "fetch & aggregate" a single file.
But since many "sources" (S3 files) can add data,
we should think about merging (reducing) multiple sources into one uber states series[^footnote3].
Thus we need `g` to "merge" two time based aggregated states into a single time based state series.
Now, file sizes range from a few MBs, up to ~10GB.
And this is important, because in the simple solution,
we cannot start `reduce`-ing the small files,
until we are done fetching and transforming the bigger 10GB files.

### Lawful properties
Interesting things to note about `g`[^footnote4]:
- `g` is assocciative, it doesn't matter how we group and merge two time based series states.
- `g` is commutative, order is irrelevant. switch LHS with RHS, and get exactly the same result.

So now, our random pure-FP dude will say: great! your category `B` sounds very similar to a _[semilattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semilattice)_.
Let's also prove that `g` abides the idempotency law, and that `g(b,b) == b` for any \\(b\in{B}\\),
and maybe we'll find a useful abstraction using semilattice properties.

Well, that FP-programmer is actually right. and all that high gibberish talk actually has solid foundations.
And in fact, that function `g` over `B` I just described does define a semilattice.
`B`s has partial ordering[^footnote5], `g` acts as the "meet" or "join" operation,
and we even have an identity element (the empty time series), so it is even a _"Bounded Semilattice"_.

But this is totally irrelevant and out of the question's scope.
Remember, we are working in an OO organization.
If we start defining abstractions over semilattices (or maybe there are ones in cats or scalaz libraries? I really don't know),
The code will become one giant pile of gibberish in the eyes of my coworkers.
And we don't even need it. What is needed, with the realization that `g` is associative & commutative,
is a very natural optimization that pops to mind: why wait for all `A => B` transformations?
whenever 2 `B`s are ready, any 2 `B`s, we can immediately apply `g` and start the merge process.

So, without over abstracting, I came up with the following piece of code (brace yourselves):
```scala
def foo[A, B](in: Iterable[A])
             (fn: A => Future[B], combop: (B,B) => Future[B])
             (implicit executor: ExecutionContext): Future[B] = {
  val promises = Array.fill(2 * in.size - 1)(Promise.apply[B])
  var i = 0 // used for iteration optimization
            // (not needing to search for uncompleted
            // promise from start every time)

  def completeNext(tb: Try[B]): Unit = {
    var j = i
    var p = promises(j)
    while ((p eq null) || !p.tryComplete(t)) {
      j += 1
      p = promises(j)
    }
    i = j
  }

  in.foreach { a =>
    fn(a).onComplete(completeNext)
  }

  promises
    .init
    .zipWithIndex
    .sliding(2,2)
    .toSeq
    .foreach { twoElems =>
      val (p1, i1) = twoElems.head
      val (p2, i2) = twoElems.last

      // andThen side effect is meant to release potentially heavy
      // elements that otherwise may stay for potentially long time
      val f1 = p1.future.andThen { case _ => promises(i1) = null }
      val f2 = p2.future.andThen { case _ => promises(i2) = null }
      f1.zip(f2)
        .flatMap(combop.tupled)
        .onComplete(completeNext)
    }
  promises.last.future
}
```

I can imagine the horror on the face of our random FP-dude, an `Array` (mutable), `var`s, side effects,... OMG. John would not approve such abomination.
But before you panic, bare with me and let's break it down.

### The what & how
The goal is have a "bucket" of ready `B` elements, and whenever we have 2 or more `B`s in the "bucket",
we take a pair out of the bucket, compute `g` on it, and when `g` returns with a new `B`, we put it right back in the "bucket",
and we continue to do so, until only a single finite `B` element is left in the bucket. this is our return value.

The way it is done, is simple. we have \\(n\\) `A` elements in the original sequence, each will be mapped to a single `B`,
and since every 2 `B`s are used to generate a new `B`, we need room for another \\(n-1\\) `B`s in the bucket.
Overall, \\(2n-1\\) elements, and our "bucket" can be just a simple `Array`. We also want to parrallelize the computation as much as we can,
so some construct to handle the asynchrounous nature of the computation is needed. I used a `Promise[B]` to store the result.
So our "bucket" is simply an `Array[Promise[B]]` of size \\(2n-1\\).

[^footnote1]: Other than maybe a tiny PR to [coursier](https://github.com/coursier/coursier) which uses scalaz.

[^footnote2]: You are reading that person's blog. Obviously :)

[^footnote3]: There are multiple ways to approach that problem, and actually,
we ended up with another solution, that utilized akka-streams,
merging multiple sources with a custom stage & `scan`ing to output a stream of aggregated state in time order.

[^footnote4]: Whenever I encounter such realization, I automatically translate it to property checks tests.
So to test that `g` is lawful, all I needed is a very simple scalacheck test to test assocciativity & commutativity.

[^footnote5]: think about `b1 != b2`, which means that `g(b1,b2) > b1` and also `g(b1,b2) > b2`.
It may be more obvious in some situations (and it was obvious in our case).
